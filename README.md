# SpaceEngineersSkeleton V 0.001.002
This is just the base structure within space engineers. The idea is that you can create a mockup class and test a mockup solution for your code. The IDE of VS should help you to create the structure of your program and classes of ingame types.

## Space Engineers Version: Current 20/05/2020

## Usage and Examples
This will be added when the skeleton is a bit more complete

### Disclaimer
This is in no way complete, I am just finishing this off as I am writing scripts for the game as I am playing it. So all the objects that I have used in game in my programming blocks are included and recreating my scripts should have helpers. Everything else I am completing on a on use basis.
