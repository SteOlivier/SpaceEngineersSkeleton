# Forward
Have you ever tried to write a program only to find someone has done it, once you started? Yeah that sucks... Anyway, if you are looking for a really good and comprehensive Space Engineers programming IDE in VS, go to this github project: [Malware's Devkit for Space Engineers](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE)

# SpaceEngineersSkeleton V 0.001.002
This is just the base structure within space engineers. The idea is that you can create a mockup class and test a mockup solution for your code. The IDE of VS should help you to create the structure of your program and classes of ingame types.

## Space Engineers Version: Current 20/05/2020

## Usage and Examples
This will be added when the skeleton is a bit more complete, however **please note** that all methods and fields marked **\[obsolete]** is not neccesarrily added on the correct opbject or correct depth. Most of these resources I merely guessed from the scripts I have already written. If any of your scipts don't work using my interpreter, feel free to send them to me (if the script is less than 200 lines of code or the broken part can be extracted to a single program file of less than 120 lines) and I will update my code to work correctly for your script as well.

### Disclaimer
This is in no way complete, I am just finishing this off as I am writing scripts for the game as I am playing it. So all the objects that I have used in game in my programming blocks are included and recreating my scripts should have helpers. Everything else I am completing on a on use basis.
